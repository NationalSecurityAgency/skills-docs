This configuration is used by the Skills Display and Skills Reporting libraries so you won't need to configure those separately.

SkillsConfiguration supplies the ***afterConfigure()*** method which returns a promise which will be resolved once the **SkillsConfiguration** ***configure*** method
completes.  This allows support, for example, for configuration options to be supplied by the server asynchronously.
