# Icons

The skills platform offers customization of icons for the following items:

- [Subjects](/dashboard/user-guide/subjects.html)
- [Badges](/dashboard/user-guide/badges.html)
- [Levels](/dashboard/user-guide/levels.html)

When creating or editing these items you can click on the default icon to bring up the icon selector: 

![Select Icon](../../screenshots/admin/modal-edit-subjectIcon.png)

The icon selector supports 2 icon packs: 

- [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Material](https://material.io/tools/icons) 

::: tip
To provide consistent branding, use the same icon packs for all of your items
