#Access Management

The Project Access menu supports adding or removing Project Administrators. Project Administrator's can modify all 
aspects of a Project, up to and including deleting a Project. The initial creator of a Project will automatically be assigned
as the Project Administrator, however, any number of Project Administrators may be assigned. A Project Administrator role is necessary to approve
self-reported Skill requests. Depending on the installation mode, a user may need to have a dashboard account before 
being added as a Project Administrator.
