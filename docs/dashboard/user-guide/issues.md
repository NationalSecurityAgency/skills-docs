# Issues

Displays any errors that have been recorded for a Project, how many times they have occurred, and when the most recent occurrence was.

![SkillTree Issues](../../screenshots/admin/page-project-issues.png)

There are a number of different issues that are captured here. One example includes attempts to report a Skill that doesn't exist in a Project. This commonly occurs when a typo has been made
during the integration of skill reporting into an application, or when switching an application from using a staging project to a production project where 
the staging skills do not exist or have been created with different Skill IDs.
