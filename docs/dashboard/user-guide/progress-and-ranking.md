## Contact Project Admins

Users consuming a micro-learning training using SkillTree can easily communicate with the administrators of that 
specific training profile. After drilling down into a specific project to view that project's progress and ranking views, a
![contact project button](./screenshots/concat_proj_btn.png) button is presented on the top right. 

The ``Contact Project`` button displays the contact form where users can enter and submit a message for that project's admins. 

![contact project form](./screenshots/contact_admins_form.png)

Once the ``Submit`` button is clicked an email with the provided message is sent to all project's admins. 

::: danger IMPORTANT
Please note that the ``Contact Project`` button is only display if the [Email Server Settings](/dashboard/user-guide/settings.html#email-settings)
are configured, otherwise the button is not displayed as emails cannot be sent.

## Daily Usage Page

You can view your daily usage for the selected projects by visiting the ``My Usage`` page from the ``My Projects`` page

![My Usage Page](../../screenshots/progress-and-ranking/page-progress-and-rankings-view-my-usage.png)

## Admin View

The admin view provides access for project administrators to create and manage training profiles. 
The page is clearly labeled with an ``Admin`` stamp which visually differentiates it from the Progress and Ranking view

![SkillTree Dashboard Admin View](../../screenshots/admin/page-projects.png)

To get started with managing a training profile create a [Project](/dashboard/user-guide/projects.html) followed by [Subjects](/dashboard/user-guide/subjects.html) and then [Skills](/dashboard/user-guide/skills.html). 
Please visit the [Building Training Profile](/dashboard/user-guide/#building-training-profile) section to learn more. 

::: tip NOTE
Please note that in the rare case that a single user creates more than 10 projects, they will be displayed in tabular format instead of the default card display.
