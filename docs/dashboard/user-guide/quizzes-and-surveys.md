# Quizzes and Surveys

Quizzes and Surveys can be created and managed on the administrative side of the SkillTree Dashboard
and seamlessly administered by associating them to [Skills](/dashboard/user-guide/self-reporting.html) or running them independently.

- [Quiz](/dashboard/user-guide/quizzes-and-surveys.html#quiz) - a knowledge check composed of multiple questions with a passing requirement
- [Survey](/dashboard/user-guide/quizzes-and-surveys.html#survey) - data collection technique utilizing one or more questions

A Quiz/Survey association to an existing skill requires successful completion of that Quiz/Survey
in order to earn the skill and its points. In the case of a quiz, then the quiz serves as the skill's knowledge check.
On the other hand associating a survey is method to get feedback about that skill or collect some pieces of important
data related to the skill.

To view existing quizzes or surveys or to create a new Quiz or Survey please navigate to `Quizzes and Surveys` page
featured under the main Navigation on the administrative part of the Dashboard.
