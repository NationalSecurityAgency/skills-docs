### Gems

window. To claim this coveted badge, you must complete all its required skills before the deadline. The expiration date
is prominently displayed on the badge card across all badge
views: [My Badges](/training-participation/take-training.html#my-badges-page), and the Badge details
page.

award icon will appear in the badge card across all views: on
your [My Badges](/training-participation/take-training.html#my-badges-page) page and the Badge
details page.

## Skill Page

To access a Skill page, simply click on the skill's name or progress bar from the Subject Page.
A Skill represents a single, focused step in your learning journey. The skill description will guide you on how to master it.

The Skill Overview page provides a comprehensive view of your progress, including:
- Skill name and description
- Total available and earned points
- Points earned today

Repetition is often essential for effective learning, so some skills may require multiple successful completions. The
training configuration determines whether you can earn multiple completions immediately or if there's a time window
requiring a minimum number of hours between completions. The Skill Overview's progress and information cards clearly
show how many occurrences/points are available and how many have been completed.

![client-display-skill-page-avatar.png](../screenshots/progress-and-ranking/client-display-skill-page-avatar.png)

Additional optional elements may appear in the skill details, depending on the skill type and configuration:
- **Badges**: Links to badges earned by completing this skill
- **Self-Reporting**: Instructions for self-reporting progress and achieving consecutive completions (see [Self Reporting](/training-participation/take-training.html#self-reporting) for more details)
- **Skill Tags**: Categories assigned by the training creator
- **Prerequisites**: A list of required skills and a visual dependency graph
- **Enhanced Media**: Optional video or audio content to enrich the learning experience
- **Expiration**: A clear deadline indicating when the skill will expire (if applicable)

### Self Reporting

Skills with a self-report tag can be marked as completed directly by the learner. For example, the skill below has an Honor tag and can be earned immediately.

![client-display-self-report-honor-tag.png](../screenshots/progress-and-ranking/client-display-self-report-honor-tag.png)

Here multiple self-reporting types that skills can be created with:
- **Honor System**: Points are awarded immediately upon self-reporting completion
- **Approval Queue**: Your request enters an approval queue for review by training administrators

you'll receive points; if denied, no points will be awarded. However, both your request and the response will remain
visible in the history below the description.

The justification field uses the SkillTree Rich Text Editor, allowing for a wide range of information to be included in
your justification.

### Expiration

Training creators can configure skill achievements to expire after a set period, allowing users to re-earn them later.
There are two types of expiration:

#### Date-Based Expiration

Skill achievements expire on a specific date and can be re-earned afterward. The expiration date is displayed above the
progress bar, right below the earned points.

#### Time-Based Expiration

Skill achievements expire after a set number of days but can be re-earned at any time. Each time the skill is completed,
the timer resets and the expiration is extended by the configured number of days. The expiration deadline and an option
to re-perform the skill are displayed above the progress bar, right below the earned points.
