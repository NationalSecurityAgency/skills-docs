is prominently displayed on the badge card across all badge
views: [My Badges](/training-participation/take-training.html#my-badges-page), and the Badge details
page.

## Skill Page

To access a Skill page, simply click on the skill's name or progress bar from the Subject Page.
A Skill represents a single, focused step in your learning journey. The skill description will guide you on how to master it.

The Skill Overview page provides a comprehensive view of your progress, including:
- Skill name and description
- Total available and earned points
- Points earned today

Repetition is often essential for effective learning, so some skills may require multiple successful completions. The
training configuration determines whether you can earn multiple completions immediately or if there's a time window
requiring a minimum number of hours between completions. The Skill Overview's progress and information cards clearly
show how many occurrences/points are available and how many have been completed.

![client-display-skill-page-avatar.png](../screenshots/progress-and-ranking/client-display-skill-page-avatar.png)

Additional optional elements may appear in the skill details, depending on the skill type and configuration:
