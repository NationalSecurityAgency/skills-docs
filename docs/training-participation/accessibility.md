# Accessibility

SkillTree is committed to providing an inclusive and accessible learning experience for all users. This guide outlines the accessibility features and best practices to enhance your experience with the platform.

If you're interested in creating gamified training experiences rather than earning credits in existing trainings, please check out our [Administrative Accessibility Guide](/dashboard/user-guide/accessibility.html)  for more details.

## Navigation

### Basic Navigation
<Content path="/training-participation/common/accessibility-basic-nav.md"/>

### Productivity Shortcuts

On the [Skill Page](/training-participation/take-training.html#skill-page):
- `Ctrl + Alt + p` (p for previous): Navigate to the previous skill
- `Ctrl + Alt + n` (n for next): Navigate to the next skill

Please check back in often as we continue to add productivity shortcuts to the platform.

### Landmark Navigation

The heading structure is organized hierarchically to facilitate easy navigation using screen reader landmark navigation.

For example, on a single training entry page, the heading levels are organized as follows:
- The training title serves as the main heading (Level 1)
- Progress metrics and subject sections are organized under Level 2 headings:
  - Overall Points
  - My Level
  - Current Level Progress
  - My Rank
  - My Badges
  - Subjects (Level 2 heading that groups all subjects)
    - Each subject is a Level 3 heading

This heading hierarchy enables efficient navigation through screen readers. For example, using JAWS Screen Reader:
1. List all headings with `INSERT+F6`
2. Navigate directly to the first subject by pressing `3` for the first Level 3 heading
3. Press `3` again to move to the next subject heading
4. Once you reach your desired subject, press `Tab` to access the `View` button

## Video, Multimedia and Images

Please note that training content is managed by the creators who are responsible for ensuring their content is
accessible. This is particularly important for skill descriptions, uploaded videos, multimedia, and meaningful images.

SkillTree Platform provides features to enhance accessibility for training creators to utilize:
- Add descriptive alt text to meaningful images
- Add captions to uploaded videos
- Add transcripts to video and audio files

If you encounter any accessibility barriers, please contact either your [training's creators](/training-participation/take-training.html#contact) or the SkillTree support team.

## Rich Text Editor

The Rich Text Editor enhances text entry across various pages, including self-reporting justifications and text input
quiz/survey questions. It supports both tab-based navigation and keyboard shortcuts for text editing:
